        <h5>More about me</h5>
        <p class="dad"> I have an older sister who just graduated highschool. She will be going to UC Davis. I am very happy that I wil be getting my own room. One of my hobbies is baking. I love baking its so much fun and it's calming. I prefer to bake sugar cookies, they taste really good. I am also into planting. I am really sad that my flowers started to bloom and I was'nt able to see it since I am at SMASH. </p>
